After you've accepted the invitation to collaborate, you can then clone the repository to your computer
How to clone a repository:
https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository

some useful git commands:
init => initializes an empty repository in the directory you run the command in
(adds a .git folder)
clone => 
add (filename or "." to add everything) => adds files to stage
commit -m "commit message" => commits staged changes
push => uploads commit to remote repository

Example command sequences:
# Cloning this repository
Open Git Bash
$ mkdir thisrepo && cd thisrepo
$ git clone git@github.com:charlesancheta/bigkek.git
# Uploading your changes to the repository
$ git add . (if you want to stage all changes) or git add filename1 filename2 (and so on) (if you only want to change specific files)
$ git commit -m "my lab solution"
$ git push
