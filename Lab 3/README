Best Way to organize your code

include/ should have all your header (.h) files
src/ should have all your source code (.c) files
obj/ is where your compiled object files (.o) will go

Also makes it compatible with your makefile
- To change the name of the program, go to the Makefile and change the EXE variable
- To compile your code and make an executable, type "make" on the command line
